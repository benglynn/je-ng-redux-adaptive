# Consumer app web prototype

A prototype of the Just Eat web app that follows the [common adaptive architecture](https://goo.gl/coMJHq).

## Develop & test locally

### In VS Code for macOS

* Serve with `Cmd+Shift+B` (integrated terminal: ``Cmd+` ``)
* Debug in Chrome with `F5`(debugger: `Cmd+Shift+Y`)

### In the terminal

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Alterntively run `ng serve --open`.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
